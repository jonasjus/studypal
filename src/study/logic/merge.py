"""Merging study data from two devices, row by row.

A dataset is {table: {uid: row}}; each row is a dict with "uid", "updated" (when it last changed)
and its fields, with links to other rows given by uid ("course": "<uid>").

merge3 compares each row against the last shared version (base):
- changed on one side only: that side wins (including a deletion);
- changed on both: the newer change wins;
- deleted on one side and edited on the other: the edit is kept, so nothing is lost.

repair then makes the result consistent: rows whose parent was deleted get the parent back,
and duplicates of things that must be unique (a course code, a chapter number within a book)
are combined or renamed.
