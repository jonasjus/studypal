"""Which deadline alerts are due right now, without ever repeating one.

Each threshold ("7d", "2d", "1d", "morning") fires once per deadline. If several thresholds
have passed since the last check (the laptop was asleep, or the deadline was added late),
only the most urgent one is sent and the rest are marked as sent with it, so you get one
alert instead of a burst. Deadlines that are done or already past send nothing.
